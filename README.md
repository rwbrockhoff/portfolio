# Portfolio

I used my portfolio as an opportunity to create another React project to showcase my recent projects.  

## Design

The gradient/animated background was created by hand in Adobe Illustrator. All elements were hand styled without Bootstrap or any templates. FontAwesome was used for general icons. 

### Firebase

This portfolio is hosted on Firebase using Firebase hosting and functions (Express server for SendGrid).
